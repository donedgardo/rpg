+Create a system inside level.rs, this system will keep track of a new resource called InputSnapshots which will keep track of each players input through each frame. Make it first in first out and limit it to 15 frames as the memory constrait. This system will run in the schedule LocalPlaySchedule.

+Lets add a jump feature using in the input module. I want the feature to work for both local and network games. Use https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/character_controller/ and change the inputs of movement to instead of chaging velocity use the new rapier controller.
